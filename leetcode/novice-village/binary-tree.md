# Binary Tree

A Binary Tree is a type of tree data structure where each node can have a maximum of two child nodes,
a left child node and a right child node, either allow empty.

The root node maximum has two child nodes(the degree between 0 ~ 2), and each child node can have two child nodes, and so on.

- The `left child` node is the child node to the left.

- The `right child` node is the child node to the right.

- The `tree height` is the maximum number of edges from the root node to a leaf node.

## Variants

There are different variants, or types, of Binary Trees:

1. `Complete Binary Tree`:
   All levels full of nodes, except the last level, which is can also be full, or filled from left to right.

2. `Full Binary Tree`:
   A kind of tree where each node has either 0 or 2 child nodes.

3. `Perfect Binary Tree`:
   All leaf nodes on the same level, which means that all levels are full of nodes, and all internal nodes have two child nodes.

4. `Skewed Binary Tree`:
   All the nodes have only either one child or no child. It can be either left-skewed or right-skewed.
