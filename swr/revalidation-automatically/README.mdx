# Revalidation Automatically

1. Revalidation on Focus

```tsx
/*
	If the window be focused, 

	the SWR will invoke fetcher automaticly to 

	**revalidate data(immediately synchronize data).**

	This feature is enabled by default, deponds on `revalidateOnFocus` option
*/
```

1. Revalidate on Interval(For Polling data)

```tsx
/*
	Useful when the data changes because of multiple devices, multiple users, multiple tabs,

	**The SWR only refetching by the associated with hook in the screen,** 
	not all of hook has refreshInteral option.
	

	This feature is disabled by default is zero, depends on `**refreshInterval**` option.

	There're also options such as `**refreshWhenHidden**` and `**refreshWhenOffline**`. 
	
	Both are disabled by default.
*/
```

1. Revalidate on Reconnect

```tsx
/*
	Useful to make sure the data is always up-to-date,

	SWR **automatically revalidates when network recovers**.

	This feature is enabled by default, depends on the `**revalidateOnReconnect**` option.
*/
```

1. Revalidate on Mount

```tsx
/*
	The SWR hook mounts as following steps,

	1. check the `revalidateOnMount` option was defined, default is undefined.

			If true, starts request, otherwish see the next step.
	
			P.S. the revalidateOnMount could force override SWR revalidation on mounting
	
	
	2. check the `revalidateIfStale` option to revalidation, default is true.
	 
*/
```

1. Disabled revalidation data cause the data is immutable never change

```tsx
// 1. useSWRImmutable hook
import useSWRImmutable from 'swr/immutable'
 
useSWRImmutable(key, fetcher, options)

//	2. useSWR following some options and it will equivalent to useSWRImmutable.
useSWR(key, fetcher, {
  revalidateIfStale: false,
  revalidateOnFocus: false,
  revalidateOnReconnect: false
})
```
